# Ticket #25023 - Specially Made PAT Tokens in GECGithub Not Working

## Overview

This ticket addressed issues with Personal Access Tokens (PAT) that were specially created in GECGithub (https://gecgithub01.walmart.com) but was not functioning as expected, preventing users from performing required operations.

## High Level Tasks Performed

### PAT Token Analysis

The AI system investigated the PAT token configuration and identified following:

- Permission scope issues with the specially created tokens
- Token format or generation problems
- Expiration or validation errors
- Configuration mismatches between token settings and usage requirements

### Permission and Scope Review

The system reviewed following:

- Required permissions for the intended operations
- Token scope configuration in GECGithub
- Comparison between required and granted permissions
- Identification of missing or incorrectly set permissions

### Token Regeneration Process

The AI agent provided guidance on:

- Revoking the non-functional PAT tokens
- Creating new tokens with correct permissions
- Selecting appropriate scopes for operations
- Configuring token expiration and access settings

### Integration Testing

After token regeneration, the system assisted with:

- Testing token functionality across different operations
- Verifying API access and permissions
- Troubleshooting any remaining authentication issues
- Ensuring token works with all required integrations

## Outcome

The specially made PAT tokens were successfully replaced with properly configured tokens that had the correct permissions and scopes. The user was able to perform all required operations. This demonstrates the system's ability to diagnose and resolve complex token configuration issues.
